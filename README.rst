SlicerCustomAppTemplate by Kitware
==================================

This project is a template to be used as a starting point for creating a custom 3D Slicer application.

`3D Slicer`_ is an open-source and extensible application for visualization and medical image
analysis. 3D Slicer works with optical imaging, MRI, CT, and ultrasound data.

At `Kitware`_, we help customers develop commercial products based on 3D Slicer and we have used the platform to rapidly prototype solutions in nearly every aspect of medical imaging.
