SlicerCustomAppTemplate by Kitware
==================================

This project is a template to be used as a starting point for creating a custom 3D Slicer application.

`3D Slicer`_ is an open-source and extensible application for visualization and medical image
analysis. 3D Slicer works with optical imaging, MRI, CT, and ultrasound data.

At `Kitware`_, we have applied 3D Slicer to research and commercial applications ranging from
pre-clinical animal studies, to surgical planning and guidance, to ultrasound image analysis, to
medical robot control, to population studies.
